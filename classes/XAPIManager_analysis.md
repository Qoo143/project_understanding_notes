# XAPIManager.php Analysis

This file defines the `XAPIManager` class, a comprehensive and well-engineered solution for managing xAPI (Experience API) learning records. Its core responsibility is to translate internal application events (e.g., watching a video, answering a question) into the standardized xAPI Statement format and send them to a Learning Record Store (LRS).

## Key Features:

1.  **Configuration-Driven**:
    *   The class is highly configurable through PHP constants (e.g., `XAPI_ENDPOINT`, `XAPI_USERNAME`, `XAPI_ENABLED`). This allows for easy setup and modification across different environments (development, staging, production) without changing the code.

2.  **Robust Statement Construction (`buildXAPIStatement`)**:
    *   This is the heart of the class. It provides a structured process for creating valid xAPI Statements.
    *   `buildActor`: Constructs the learner object, including support for anonymization.
    *   `buildVerb`: Maps internal application actions (e.g., '練習題_對') to standard xAPI verbs (e.g., 'answered correctly') using a predefined mapping array. This is a clean way to handle translations.
    *   `buildObject`, `buildResult`, `buildContext`: These methods create the other essential parts of a statement, enriching the learning record with details about the activity, success, score, duration, and context (like course or class ID).

3.  **Offline Storage and Resiliency (Fault Tolerance)**:
    *   **Critical Feature**: This is the class's most significant strength. If sending a statement to the LRS fails (e.g., due to network issues), the `sendStatement` method returns `false`, and the `logAction` method then calls `storeOfflineStatement` to save the record to a local database table (`xapi_offline_statements`). This prevents data loss and ensures reliability.
    *   `initializeStorage`: The class can automatically create the required database table on initialization, which simplifies deployment and setup.

4.  **Batch Processing and Retry Mechanism (`processPendingStatements`)**:
    *   The class includes a method to process pending statements stored in the local database. This can be run periodically (e.g., via a cron job) to send offline records to the LRS in batches.
    *   It includes a retry mechanism (`retry_count`) to attempt resending failed statements a configured number of times, preventing indefinite retries for permanently failing records.

## Conclusion:

`XAPIManager` is a professional, production-ready class for xAPI integration. It is designed to be configurable, robust, and resilient to network failures. Its offline storage and batch processing capabilities make it a reliable tool for capturing detailed learning analytics, which is essential for any modern e-learning platform.
