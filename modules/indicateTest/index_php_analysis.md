# indicateTest/index.php Analysis

This file serves as a **developer or administrator interface** for managing and visualizing a knowledge structure (Concept Structure), rather than being a student-facing entry point for a test.

## Key Functions:

1.  **Developer Tools**:
    *   The page presents several buttons typical of a backend tool: "產生結構_國語" (Generate Structure_Chinese), "模擬測驗" (Simulate Test), and "更新map_node_student_status" (Update map_node_student_status).
    *   The line `unset( $_SESSION['indicateTest'] );` clears any existing session data for the test, which is a common practice on a reset or testing page.

2.  **Knowledge Structure Visualization**:
    *   The core feature of this page is an `iframe` that loads `modules/D3/app/index_view.php`. The "D3" in the path strongly implies that it uses the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library to render a data visualization.
    *   The script fetches all "big nodes" (`bNodes`) and "small nodes" (`sNodes`) from the `map_node` database table for a hardcoded map serial number (`map_sn=10`).
    *   It then initializes adjacency matrices (`bNodeMatrix`, `sNodeMatrix`) for these nodes and injects all this data into frontend JavaScript variables as JSON.

3.  **Frontend Interaction**:
    *   The page includes `indicateTest.js`. This JavaScript file likely uses the injected node data and the D3.js library to draw an interactive graph or network diagram of the knowledge structure.
    *   This visualization would allow an administrator to see the relationships between different concepts and skills.
    *   The buttons on the page would trigger JavaScript functions in `indicateTest.js` to perform actions like saving the structure.

## Conclusion:

`modules/indicateTest/index.php` is a backend administrative tool for visualizing and manipulating the node structure of a knowledge map. It is not the starting point for a student taking a test. Its primary purpose is to provide a graphical interface, powered by D3.js, for managing the underlying concept structure.
