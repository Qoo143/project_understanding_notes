# UserStatusLog.php Analysis

This file defines the `UserStatusLog` class, which serves as an interface for querying a log table that records significant events in a user's lifecycle.

## Core Purpose:

The class is designed to retrieve user information from the `user_status_log` table based on specific actions performed on user accounts. It provides a method to look up historical user status changes.

## Functional Breakdown:

1.  **Constants for Standardization**:
    *   `OPERATOR_*`: Defines constants for actions like `Register`, `Login`, `Disable`, `Enable`, and `Delete`. This enforces consistency and avoids the use of magic strings.
    *   `TABLE_NAME`: Centralizes the name of the database table (`user_status_log`) for easier maintenance.

2.  **`getUserIDList()` Static Method**:
    *   **Functionality**: This is the sole method in the class. It retrieves a list of user IDs.
    *   **Query Logic**: It performs a `JOIN` between `user_status_log` and the `seme_student` table. This indicates its primary use is to find students within a specific semester who have been affected by a certain action.
    *   **Parameters**: It filters based on the action (`$sOperator`), the organization (`$sOrgnizationID`), the user who performed the update (`$sUpdaterID`), and the semester (`$sSemeYearSeme`).
    *   **Example Use Case**: This could be used to answer a question like, "Which students did a specific teacher register for their class during the current semester?"
    *   **Return Value**: It correctly utilizes the `ResultRecord` class to return a standardized success or error object, which is consistent with the project's design patterns.

3.  **Missing Functionality**:
    *   Notably, the class is named `UserStatusLog` but lacks any methods for **writing** to the log (e.g., an `addLog()` method). This implies that the logic for recording these events is handled elsewhere in the application, and this class was created specifically for this query/reporting purpose.

## Conclusion:

`UserStatusLog` is a specialized utility class for querying the user status history. It provides a clean, specific interface for retrieving lists of users based on past actions and adheres to the project's standard of using `ResultRecord` for structured responses.
